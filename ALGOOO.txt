Recap
Woohoo, congratulations! We have mastered the linear data structure.

During this super skill, we have seen what we called the static structure:
The array and matrix (they are called like that due to their static length),
The string which is an array of characters with specific methods (like concat),
The structure (Struct) which the one that gives us the ability to create our own structure.
The abstract data structure like stacks and queues.
The hash table which refers to a dictionary or a map in programming languages, which is used to store a key-value map.
The linked list which is a dynamic data structure.

ALGO 3

Parameters are the names of the information that is used in a function or procedure
An argument is a value that is passed into a function or procedure

Recap
Congratulation!

Now, we have mastered the procedural programming which is the solution that makes our way of programming much more efficient.
Il also help us produce more readable and easy to maintain algorithm.
We have also set the difference between function and procedure.
And finally, we have learned how to make procedure and function communicate with each other using the parameter ticket
